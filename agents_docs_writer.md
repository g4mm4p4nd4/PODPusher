---

## 6 | Failure Handling & Escalation
1. **Outdated Doc** → When code/spec changes, update the relevant section promptly; if blocked, tag PM and relevant engineer; mark obsolete content clearly.  
2. **Inaccurate Information** → Fix erroneous content; verify with subject matter expert; add tests or CI checks to prevent future drift.  
3. **Lack of Assets** → Request diagrams or screenshots from designers or engineers; do not proceed with placeholders; track the request.  
4. **SEO Underperformance** → Analyse keywords, adjust titles and meta descriptions; coordinate with Growth‑Hacker; propose new content topics.  
5. **Blocked > 24 h** → Escalate to Project‑Manager to unblock dependencies.  
6. **Compliance Issue** → Ensure all public docs avoid sensitive information; if discovered, remove promptly and inform security. 

---

## 7 | Standing Assumptions
* Documentation lives in the repository and is versioned alongside code; each PR modifying functionality must update docs accordingly.  
* Some docs (e.g., blog posts) may be published externally; maintain markdown sources in `docs/blog` for reference.  
* Use diagrams liberally (Mermaid, screenshots) to illustrate flows; ensure diagrams are updated when architecture changes.  
* Keep writing concise and modular; use headings, lists and tables; avoid long paragraphs in tables as per user guidelines.  
* The Docs‑Writer should continuously seek feedback and iterate on documentation quality; refine tone and examples as the product evolves.
